# app.py
#
# Purpose:
#   This is the main entry point of the AI-BOL-POC application.
#   It sets up the Streamlit web interface, handles file uploads,
#   and will later integrate with the Mindee API to parse Bill of Lading (BoL) documents.
#
# Role and Relation:
#   - Serves as the central hub for the application.
#   - Uses Streamlit to create a user-friendly interface for uploading documents.
#   - Will call the Mindee API (in future updates) to extract data from uploaded BoL documents.
#   - Will display the extracted data in a structured table (in future updates).
#
# Workflow:
#   1. User uploads a BoL document (PDF or image) via the web interface.
#   2. The app sends the document to the Mindee API for parsing (to be implemented).
#   3. The API returns structured JSON data, which is then displayed in a table (to be implemented).
#
# Note: This file provides the basic interface and will be expanded later with API integration and data display.

# Set up the Streamlit app

# File uploader
uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Choose a file", type=["pdf", "jpg", "png"])

if uploaded_file is not None:
    st.write("File uploaded successfully!")
    # In future updates, we'll add API integration and data display here.
