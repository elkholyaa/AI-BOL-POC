File: google_sheet_key_fetcher.py

Purpose:
    This script demonstrates how to read an API key from a private Google Sheet using a
    service account. It authenticates with a JSON credentials file and retrieves the key
    stored in a specified cell (default is A1) of the first worksheet.
    
Role & Integration:
    - Uses the Google Sheets API via gspread and google-auth libraries.
    - The API key (for example, for Mindee) is stored in a private Google Sheet.
    - This approach helps you manage the key securely without hardcoding it in your code.
    
Workflow:
    1. Create a Google Sheet (e.g., named "API Keys") and store your API key in cell A1.
    2. Create a service account in Google Cloud Console, enable the Google Sheets API,
       and download the JSON credentials file (e.g., "service_account_credentials.json").
    3. Share the Google Sheet with the service accountâ€™s email.
    4. Run this script to retrieve and print the API key.
    
Usage Instructions:
    1. Install dependencies:
         pip install gspread google-auth
    2. Place "service_account_credentials.json" in the same directory as this file.
    3. Ensure your Google Sheet (named "API Keys" by default) has your API key in cell A1.
    4. Run:
         python google_sheet_key_fetcher.py

Security Tips:
    - Keep the JSON credentials file private. Do not commit it to a public repository.
    - Restrict access to your Google Sheet to only the service account and trusted collaborators.
